                <div class="faq-content">
                    MassaPay is a self-custodial mobile wallet for the Massa blockchain. It allows you to securely store, send, receive, and swap MAS tokens and other assets on the Massa network. Your private keys are stored locally on your device and never shared with anyone.

                <div class="faq-content">
                    Yes! MassaPay is fully compatible with Massa Station and Bearby wallets. You can import your existing wallet using your 24-word recovery phrase. The derivation path <code>m/44'/632'/0'/0'</code> is the same across all Massa wallets.

                    Yes, you can import your wallet on multiple devices using your 24-word recovery phrase. However, for security reasons, we recommend keeping your primary wallet on a single device. Remember: anyone with your recovery phrase has full access to your funds.

                <div class="faq-content">
                    Yes, MassaPay is designed with security as a top priority:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>100% Open Source</strong> - You can verify every line of code on GitHub</li>
                        <li><strong>Industry-standard cryptography</strong> - secp256k1 curve, AES-256 encryption</li>
                        <li><strong>Local storage only</strong> - Keys never leave your device</li>
                        <li><strong>Android Keystore</strong> - Hardware-backed security when available</li>
                        <li><strong>VirusTotal verified</strong> - 0/71 detections</li>
                        <li><strong>Zero data collection</strong> - No analytics, no tracking</li>

                <summary>Is my recovery phrase stored securely?</summary>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    Your recovery phrase is encrypted using AES-256 and stored in Android's secure enclave (Keystore). It never leaves your device and is never transmitted over the network. The encryption key is protected by your PIN/biometrics and cannot be extracted even if your device is rooted.

                <div class="faq-content">
                    As long as you have your 24-word recovery phrase written down safely, you can restore your wallet on any new device. Your funds are stored on the Massa blockchain, not on your phone. Without the recovery phrase, there is no way to recover your wallet - so always keep it safe offline!

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <strong>No.</strong> MassaPay collects absolutely zero user data. There are no analytics, no crash reporting services, no telemetry. The app communicates only with Massa blockchain nodes to fetch balances and broadcast transactions. Your privacy is fully respected.

                <summary>What's the derivation path used?</summary>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    MassaPay uses the standard Massa derivation path: <code>m/44'/632'/0'/0'</code>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>44'</code> - BIP-44 purpose (hardened)</li>
                        <li><code>632'</code> - Massa coin type (hardened)</li>
                        <li><code>0'</code> - Account index (hardened)</li>
                        <li><code>0'</code> - Change index (hardened)</li>
                    </ul>
                    This ensures compatibility with Massa Station, Bearby, and any other standard Massa wallet.

                <div class="faq-content">
                    Massa uses the <strong>secp256k1</strong> elliptic curve - the same battle-tested curve used by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key features:

                    By default, MassaPay connects to official Massa nodes:
                    <ul>

                <summary>Is MassaPay compatible with hardware wallets?</summary>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    Currently, no hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor) has native Massa support. MassaPay cannot connect to hardware wallets until Massa develops an official hardware wallet app. However, MassaPay's local security with Android Keystore provides strong protection for your keys.

                <div class="faq-content">
                    Massa uses a "roll" system for staking:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Buy rolls</strong> - Each roll costs 100 MAS</li>
                        <li><strong>Stake automatically</strong> - Your rolls participate in block production</li>
                        <li><strong>Earn rewards</strong> - Receive MAS for validating blocks</li>
                        <li><strong>Sell rolls</strong> - Convert back to liquid MAS anytime</li>
                    </ol>
                    MassaPay shows estimated APY and allows you to manage rolls directly from the app.

                <summary>How do token swaps work?</summary>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <strong>Everything happens inside MassaPay</strong> - no need to visit external websites!
                    <br><br>
                    We use the <strong>Dusa protocol</strong> (Massa's main DEX) under the hood to execute swaps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Select tokens to swap (e.g., MAS → USDC)</li>
                        <li>Enter amount and see real-time quote</li>
                        <li>Review price impact and fees</li>
                        <li>Confirm and sign the transaction</li>
                    </ul>
                    MassaPay acts as an <strong>all-in-one solution</strong>: you get the same DEX functionality without leaving your wallet. Swaps are executed on-chain through Dusa's liquidity pools, but the entire experience is integrated into our app.

                    MassaPay scans known NFT collections automatically. If your NFT doesn't appear:

                        <li>Tap "Add Collection"</li>
                        <li>Enter the smart contract address</li>
                        <li>The app will scan and discover your NFTs</li>
                    </ol>

                <summary>What if MassaPay stops working or gets removed?</summary>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <strong>Your funds are always safe!</strong> MassaPay is just a window to the blockchain - your crypto lives on Massa, not in the app.
                    <br><br>
                    If MassaPay ever stops working, gets uninstalled, or becomes unavailable:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Your 24-word recovery phrase is universal</strong> - It works with any compatible wallet</li>
                        <li><strong>Import to Bearby</strong> - Browser extension wallet for Massa</li>
                        <li><strong>Import to Massa Station</strong> - Official desktop wallet</li>
                        <li><strong>Any BIP-39 compatible Massa wallet</strong> - Same derivation path works everywhere</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    We use the standard derivation path <code>m/44'/632'/0'/0'</code> - the same as Bearby and Massa Station. Your seed phrase will generate the exact same address in any of these wallets.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>This is the power of self-custody:</strong> You're never locked into one app. Your keys, your crypto, your freedom.

                <summary>Why does the dApps browser use Bearby instead of MassaPay?</summary>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    When you connect to dApps through MassaPay's built-in browser, the connection uses the <strong>Bearby protocol</strong>. This is because most dApp frontends (like Dusa, NFT marketplaces, etc.) only have Bearby integration available as their wallet connection option - they haven't added MassaPay as a native choice yet.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Don't worry - it's still your wallet!</strong> MassaPay injects Bearby-compatible signatures so you can use any Massa dApp seamlessly. Your transactions are signed with your MassaPay private keys, not Bearby's. As more dApps add native MassaPay support, we'll update the integration.

                <div class="faq-content">
                    Massa has fast block times (~16 seconds), so transactions usually confirm quickly. If a transaction is stuck:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wait a minute</strong> - Network congestion can cause delays</li>

                        <li><strong>Insufficient fees</strong> - The transaction might have failed</li>
                    </ul>
                    Unlike Ethereum, Massa doesn't have a mempool, so stuck transactions will either confirm or fail.
